# reading_code
## This repository is to help people learn to read code

##### Note:
I set this up using the `Poetry` dependency manager, you can find more info on it here: [https://poetry.eustace.io/](https://poetry.eustace.io/)

##### Note:
If the examples need further explanation, please add a README in the directory itself.
